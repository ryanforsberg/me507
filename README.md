Cal Poly ME 507 Sumo Bot Project

Board is Missing:
* Headers/Connectors for edge sensors
* Any potential for mouse use (5V regulator system needed, plus USART breakout)
* Opponent painting potential
* Breakout of extra pins
* Mounting holes
* Lower ground plane
* Motor B power planes

Other todos:
* Potentially remap inputs to make routing simpler
* Confirm pad sizes with Charlie, probably need to be redone for sufficient room for solder... (_great_).
* ???
* Profit
