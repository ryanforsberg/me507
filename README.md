Cal Poly ME 507 Sumo Bot Project

Board is Missing:
* Headers/Connectors for edge sensors - use JST ZH connectors
* Opponent painting potential
* Breakout of extra pins
* Mounting holes

Other todos:
* Potentially remap inputs to make routing simpler
* Download and use Oshpark design rules to be used for DRC
* Confirm pad sizes with Charlie, probably need to be redone for sufficient room for solder... (_great_).
* ???
* Profit
