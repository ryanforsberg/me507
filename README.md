Cal Poly ME 507 Sumo Bot Project

Board is Missing:
* Silkscreen/Labeling
* AREF!!! Check the datasheet - looks like the only internal reference is Vcc/2!!! We can ditch one of the leftover analog input to get AREFA tied to AVCC... But then, we are blind AF

Other todos:
* Confirm pad sizes with Charlie, probably need to be redone for sufficient room for solder... (_great_)
* ???
* Profit
