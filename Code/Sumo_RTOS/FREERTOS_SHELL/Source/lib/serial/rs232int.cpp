/** \file rs232int.cpp
 *    This file contains a class which allows the use of a serial port on an AVR 
 *    microcontroller. This version of the class uses the serial port receiver 
 *    interrupt and a buffer to allow characters to be received in the background.
 *    The port is used in "text mode"; that is, the information which is sent and 
 *    received is expected to be plain ASCII text, and the set of overloaded left-shift 
 *    operators "<<" in emstream.* can be used to easily send all sorts of data 
 *    to the serial port in a manner similar to iostreams (like "cout") in regular C++. 
 *
 *  Revised:
 *    \li 09-14-2017 CTR Adapted from JRR code for AVR to be compatibile with xmega series

 *  many drivers which use interrupts, including this one, and then enable interrupts
